# Edward's ideas for LittleBigSnake.

This document file was created as an idea dump by myself. I want to express my ideas in a manor that is readable, approachable, and understandable. By creating this markdown file, I had three goals in mind: inform the developers, educate the developers, and solute the developers. Anything I say should not be offensive, and if it is, I apologize in advice. In the most recent game updates, it can be inferred that LittleBigSnake is planning on an expansion. In order to expand as they hope, the developers must be aware that community is key. Currently, the developers do not recognize the community as a valuable asset in their growth and prosperity. 


## Discourse - A New Feedback Forum
As of right now, UserReport is the official forum of LittleBigSnake. There are *several* issues with UserReport as compared to Discourse. Below, I will list all of them. I am also going to ***strongly*** suggest using Discourse.
 
  1) Discourse is a user-friendly platform that can be managed easily. In UserReport, one must login on a seperate panel in order to manage posts. On a Discourse forum, forum staff can delete, flag, lock, hide, open, close, move, and manage posts easily. They can manage users and several other things. This is a **great** advantage over UserReport as it not only makes it easier to moderate, but more enjoyable for people to use.
  2) Community members level up and gain more respect and permissions as they post more and help out! Unlike UserReport, anyone can unlock badges that give them special permissions by helping out in the forum. 
  3) Discourse organizes posts into categories. This is quite useful as it makes it easier for people to find specific posts. Also, posters aren't restricted to posting just bugs and feedback, but they can also create discussion posts, message forum staff about game needs, and ask billing questions. 
  4) Discourse allows players to authenticate with 3rd parties (like LittleBigSnake!) This way, users can customize their own account. 
  
  
  ## Get The Discord Server Partnered or Verified
  The Discord server is a base for users to chat, hang out, and communicate. By partnering with Discord, LittleBigSnake will unlock perks like free advertising, a vanity url, higher graphics quality, higher audio quality, more users, more administrative powers, and the ability to have a searchable server. 
  
  ## More Volunteer-to-Developer Communication
  I know, I know, the developers are busy. But, I feel like if Little and Bill were able to communicate with staff more, we could get more done, and not have to put such a burden on Sunday. 
  
  ## MORE TWITTER!!!!
  Right now, the LittleBigSnake Twitter is underused (as are the rest of its media outlets.) Twitter is an expanding and ever-growing platform in which users can receive updates about LittleBigSnake. They can also showoff and other things. 
  
  ## Connect Media Outles
  I, along with other people, feel that LittleBigSnake's media profiles are seperate, and don't inner-conect. This makes it hard for users to navigate between pages, get information, etc.
  
  Thank you for reading,
  Edward :)
